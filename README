---------------------------------------------------------------------
All you should need to do, is:
1st -	Setup Global Variables

2nd - 	Fill in the source, and destination Array with all the directories
	you want backed up.
	Source[i] needs to make with its specified Destintion[i]

3rd - 	Same deal with database's if you you it backed up. Also need to give
	mysql database username, and password.

4th -	Set the email to yours, or else when it fails you wont get an email!

5th -	Cronjob the baby

Pretty sure that sums it up.
